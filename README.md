# RavenSCAD
repository of openSCAD objects, and libraries; for 3d modeling, and printing.

## In General
this repository contains template files, library files, and scad object files. Where possible all object and libary files shall be externally callable in their own modules so that you can use whatever you like.

## Getting Started
Simply call any libary and use it as you please. You may have to look at the input arguments to see what the modules expect, but in general they are as simple, and standalone as possible.
